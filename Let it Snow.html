<h1>Let it Snow</h1>
<span style="color: #003918; font-size: 30px;"><br>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Oh the weather outside is frightful<br>
But the fire is so delightful<br>
And since we've no place to go<br>
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!<br>
<br>
<br>
It doesn't show signs of stopping<br>
And I've bought some corn for popping<br>
The lights are turned way down low<br>
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!<br>
<br>
When we finally kiss good night<br>
How I'll hate going out in the storm!<br>
But if you'll really hold me tight<br>
All the way home I'll be warm<br>
<br>
The fire is slowly dying<br>
And, my dear, we're still goodbying<br>
But as long as you love me so<br>
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
