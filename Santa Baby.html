<h1>Santa Baby</h1>
<br>
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me;<br>
Been an awful good girl, Santa baby<br>
and hurry down the chimney tonightÂ <br>
<br>
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue<br>
I'll wait up for you dear, Santa baby<br>
and hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
<br>
Think of all the fun I've missed<br>
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed<br>
Next year I could be just as good...<br>
if you'd check off my Christmas list<br>
<br>
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot<br>
Been an angel all year; Santa baby,<br>
so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
<br>
Santa honey, there's one thing I really do need,<br>
the deed - To a platinum mine, Santa baby<br>
so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
<br>
Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with the duplex, and checks<br>
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie,<br>
and hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
<br>
Come and trim my Christmas tree<br>
With some decorations bought at Tiffany;<br>
I really do believe in you<br>
Let's see if you believe in me<br>
<br>
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring<br>
I don't mean a phone, Santa baby,<br>
so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
<br>
Hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
Hurry tonight
