<h1 style="font-family: quicksand; font-style: normal; font-weight: 300; color: #FFF9F9;">Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer</h1>
<span style="font-size: 24px"><br>
<span style="color: #FFFFFF">You know Dasher, and Dancer, and<br>
Prancer, and Vixen,<br>
Comet, and Cupid, and<br>
Donder and Blitzen<br>
But do you recall<br>
The most famous reindeer of all<br>
<br>
<br>
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer<br>
had a very shiny nose<br>
and if you ever saw it<br>
you would even say it glows.<br>
<br>
All of the other reindeer<br>
used to laugh and call him names<br>
They never let poor Rudolph<br>
play in any reindeer games.<br>
<br>
Then one foggy Christmas eve<br>
Santa came to say:<br>
"Rudolph with your nose so bright,<br>
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br>
<br>
Then all the reindeer loved him<br>
as they shouted out with glee,<br>
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,<br>
you'll go down in history!
